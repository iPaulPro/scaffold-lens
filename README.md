# üèóüåø Scaffold-Lens

This project is a fork of [Scaffold-ETH 2](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2) that demonstrates how to build, debug, test, and deploy an [Open Action](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/publication-actions-aka-open-actions) Module on Lens Protocol using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

## Extension üÜï

Scaffold-Lens can be used as a Scaffold-ETH 2 Extension, instead of forking the project. You can install it when using `create-eth` to create a new project:

```shell
npx create-eth@latest -e iPaulPro/scaffold-lens:ext
```

See the [ext](https://github.com/iPaulPro/scaffold-lens/tree/ext) branch for the extension-specific docs.

## Overview

Features:
- ‚úÖ Run a local EVM chain and test contracts locally with Hardhat
- ‚úÖ Deploy the full Lens Protocol on a local network üÜï

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-Lens, follow the steps below:

1. **Install**  
   Clone this repo & install dependencies
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/iPaulPro/scaffold-lens
    cd scaffold-lens
    yarn install
    ```

2. **Start a chain**  
   Run a local network in a terminal from the root directory:
    ```shell
    yarn chain
    ```

   This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

3. **Deploy**  
   On a second terminal, from the root directory, deploy the Lens contracts locally:
    ```bash
    yarn deploy
    ```

   This command deploys the full Lens Protocol on the local network as well as the example Open Action and Collect Module contracts. Put your contracts  in `packages/hardhat/contracts`. The `yarn deploy:*` commands use the scripts located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contracts to the specified network.

4. **Start the app**  
   On a third terminal, from the root directory, start your NextJS app:
    ```shell
    yarn start
    ```

   Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contracts using the contract component and review all transactions in the block explorer. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.
   
   Copy the burner wallet address from the top-right navbar menu.

## Debugging

You can debug your smart contracts using the Contract Debugger. If you haven't already, from the root directory, start your NextJS app:
```shell
yarn start
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000/debug to open the debugger. You can now call functions on your smart contracts and debug them in the browser.

## Debugging Lens Modules

To debug your Lens Modules, you can use the Open Actions Debugger UI to create and act on publications. The UI is available at `http://localhost:3000/lens`, or you can click on the "Open Actions" navigation link in the header.

Scaffold-Lens includes example contracts for Open Actions and Collect Modules in the `packages/hardhat/contracts` directory. You can use these contracts as a starting point for your own Lens Modules. The Open Actions page will automatically include any deployed Open Actions and Collect Modules in the dropdowns.

The `TipActionModule` corresponds to the [example from the Lens Docs](https://www.lens.xyz/docs/primitives/publications/open-actions#creating-open-actions-example). The `PayWhatYouWantCollectModule` is an example of an Open Action Collect Module that can be used with the core `CollectPublicationAction` Open Action.

The `/lens` page will also automatically display any ERC-20 tokens that were deployed locally in the sidebar to make it easier to use these tokens to initialize and act on publications that require token transfers.

1. **Create a Profile**  
   Before you can create publications, you need to create a profile. Click on the "Add Profile" button in the sidebar and follow the instructions to create a profile.
2. **Create a Publication**  
   Use the textarea in the main content section to create a new publication. You can select an Open Action and Collect Module to use. For example, you can create a new publication with tipping enabled using the `TipActionModule` contract.
3. **Act on a Publication**  
   You can act on publications by clicking on the "Act" button in the publication card.

## Testing

Run the smart contract unit tests from the root directory.
```shell
yarn hardhat:test
```

This will run the tests located in `packages/hardhat/test` with [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai).

## Deploying to Testnet

Once you are ready to deploy your smart contracts, there are a few things you need to adjust.

1. **Set up environment**  
   To deploy on Amoy, you'll need to set up a `.env.staging` file in the `packages/hardhat` directory. You can use the `.env.staging.example` file as a template.

   Next, generate a new account or add one to deploy the contract(s) from. Additionally, you will need to add your Alchemy API key.
   ```bash
   ALCHEMY_API_KEY=""
   DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=""
   ```

   The deployer wallet is the account that will deploy your contracts. Additionally, the deployer account will be used to execute any function calls that are part of your deployment script.

   You can generate a random account / private key with `yarn generate` or add the private key of your crypto wallet. `yarn generate` will create a random account and add the DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY to the .env file. You can check the generated account with `yarn account`.

2. **Deploy**  
   To deploy the `TipActionModule` and `PayWhatYouWantCollectModule` to Amoy you can run

   ```shell
   yarn deploy:testnet
   ```

3. **Verify**  
   You can verify your smart contract on Etherscan by running:

   ```shell
   yarn verify:testnet
   ```
---

## Deploying to Polygon Mainnet

Follow the same directions for deploying to Amoy, but use the `.env` file instead of `.env.staging`. Then, add a `:mainnet` script entry in the yarn commands, instead of `:testnet` and use `--network polygonAmoy`.

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE**: There is no reason to deploy `TipActionModule` and `PayWhatYouWantCollectModule` as they are already deployed and verified with the Protocol on mainnet.

## Using your own contracts

If you want to use your own contracts there are a few simple steps. 

1. Replace the `TipActionModule.sol` and/or `PayWhatYouWantCollectModule` contracts in `/packages/hardhat/contracts` with your own. 
2. Update the script(s) in `/packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy your contract(s) instead of the mock contracts.
3. Change the tag in the `deploy:*` scripts in `/packages/hardhat/package.json` to the tag(s) of your contract(s).
4. (Optional) Remove the `/packages/hardhat/contracts/helpers` directory and related deploy scripts unless you want to use the `TestToken` contract for testing and debugging.
